# Control-of-Quadracopter-under-Disturbed-Motion-Utilizing-Nonlinear-Observers
Bc.S. Graduation Project, a novel approach to rejecting disturbances affecting Quadrotors by leveraging linear and nonlinear observers. While traditional methods exist, the use of observers for disturbance rejection in Quadrotors remains an underexplored area.
